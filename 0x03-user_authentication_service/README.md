# 0x03. User Authentication Service

## Description
This project focuses on implementing a user authentication service in Python using Flask. While in real-world applications you should use pre-built modules or frameworks for authentication (e.g., Flask-User), this project walks you through creating an authentication mechanism step-by-step to deepen your understanding.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Declare API routes in a Flask app.
- Get and set cookies.
- Retrieve request form data.
- Return various HTTP status codes.
