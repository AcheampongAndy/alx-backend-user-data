# 0x00. Personal Data

## Project Description
This project covers the basics of handling and securing personal data in Python, particularly focusing on Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The key areas include identifying PII, implementing secure logging with data obfuscation, password encryption, and database authentication using environment variables.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Identify examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- Implement a log filter to obfuscate PII fields in log files.
- Encrypt a password and check the validity of input passwords.
- Authenticate securely to a database using environment variables.

## Requirements
- All Python files should be interpreted/compiled using Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
- Each file must end with a new line.
- The first line of all Python files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Adhere to the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.5).
- All Python files should be executable.
- The length of each file will be verified using `wc`.
- Each module, class, and function must have clear documentation:
